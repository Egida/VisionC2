### v1.6 — February 2026

#### 🔧 Core Improvements

* **Target DNS Resolution Order Changed**
  * Cloudflare DoH now prioritized over system DNS for target resolution
  * System DNS now used as final fallback instead of first attempt
  * Improves reliability in environments with restricted local DNS

* **Cron-Based Persistence on Startup**
  * Adds cron job that checks every minute if bot is running
  * Automatically restarts bot if killed, until system reboot
  * Skips if cron entry already exists to avoid duplicates

  * Bots no longer send attack status messages back to CNC
  * Cleaner server logs, reduced bandwidth overhead, CNC already tracks attacks locally
  
#### 🎨 UI / UX

* **Login Screen Redesign**

  * Animated spinner, eye-themed UI, progress-based auth feedback
  * Success/failure banners and 3-attempt lockout screen
